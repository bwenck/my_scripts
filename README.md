# my_scripts
This repository includes scripts that I have created through my adventures in learning Python and R, in addition to the scripts and data for the Archaeal histone-based chromatin structures regulate transcription elongation rates publication in Communications Biology, In Press (2024). Included are scripts and a pipeline I created to help my colleague with Marker Frequency Analysis (MFA).
