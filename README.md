This repository includes scripts that I have created through my adventures in learning Python and R, in addition to the scripts and data for the Archaeal histone-based chromatin structures regulate transcription elongation rates publication in Communications Biology, Feb 27, 2024. DOI: 10.1038/s42003-024-05928-w. Included are scripts and a pipeline I created to help my colleague with Marker Frequency Analysis (MFA).
